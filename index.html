<p>I am a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.astronomer.io/">Astronomer</a>, where I work on design and engineering of <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a> (an open source workflow management platform). Astronomer is the orchestration platform for the modern data stack. Built on Kubernetes, Astronomer makes it easy to run, monitor, and scale Apache Airflow clusters in our cloud or yours.</p>
<p>I am a strong advocate of open-source, and believe in Learning by Doing. I have contributed to <a href="https://github.com/apache/airflow">Apache Airflow</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat">OpenCV CVAT</a> repositories. </p>

<p>Prior to this, I was leading engineering team engineering teams across multiple projects in the healthcare and agriculture domains at <a href="https://www.wadhwaniai.org">Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a> which is an independent, non-profit research institute and global hub, developing AI solutions for social good. I am more of a generalist with strong backend skills. I enjoy working with all layers of the stack and have a strong belief in automation. I have implemented a complete backend, different microservices accross the projects,  data and annotation pipeline for a pest management project for which Wadhwani AI won Googleâ€™s AI impact challenge and got a 2 million grant from Google. Just a fun fact, I got a chance to a demo application in front of Sundar Pichai as part of Google AI Impact challenge.</p>
<p>I have previously worked with startup focused on AR/VR camera applications and SDKs, drone data analysis and was also founding engineer at a startup in the home improvement space where I worked on building web based solutions that leveraged classical ML models.</p>
<p>Prior to that, I obtained my B.Tech at <a href="https://www.nitw.ac.in/">NIT Warangal </a> where I founded an award (Design Challenge by <a href="https://www.isb.edu/en.html">Indian School of Business Hyderabad</a>) winning startup which built a real time position reporting system for buses without using GPS.</p>
<p> I am skilled in Python, C++, SQL, NoSQL, Apache Airflow, Django, FastAPI, Data Engineering, Analytics, and Reporting, leading engineering teams, SDLC, and hiring. I am broadly interested in Software Engineering, Vision, Data Engineering and Computer Systems.</p>
<p>I am also a robotics enthusiast and was a Fellow at Teach for India. Always an aspiring polymath!</p>
